Subject: Senvo Carrier Onboarding Flow - Design Review Package 🎨

Hi [Designer Name],

I've put together a complete package of our carrier onboarding flow for you to review and play with. Everything is ready to run!

📦 WHAT'S IN THE PACKAGE:

✅ Full working React application with all 5 onboarding pages
✅ Custom purple gradient theme with glass-morphism cards
✅ YAML specifications documenting the entire flow
✅ Detailed README with setup instructions for both Claude Code and manual setup

🎨 VISUAL HIGHLIGHTS:

• Sophisticated multi-layer purple gradient background (#A7B8FF → #745DBF)
• Semi-transparent cards with subtle drop shadows
• Diagonal texture pattern for visual depth
• Large, spacious layout (1600px max width)
• Inter font, 18px base size
• Smooth animations and transitions

🚀 TO GET STARTED:

1. Extract the ZIP file: senvo_onboarding_theme_package.zip
2. Open README_FOR_DESIGNER.md for detailed instructions
3. Choose your path:

   WITH CLAUDE CODE (easiest):
   - Open the client/ folder in Claude Code
   - Ask Claude: "Please run the development server"
   - Done! The app will open in your browser

   WITHOUT CLAUDE CODE:
   - Install Node.js 18+ if needed (nodejs.org)
   - Open Terminal, navigate to client/ folder
   - Run: npm install
   - Run: npm run dev
   - Open browser to localhost:5173

📝 WHAT TO REVIEW:

• Overall visual flow and brand consistency
• Purple gradient and color harmony
• Typography hierarchy and readability
• Spacing and layout proportions
• Button styles and hover states
• Form field designs and interactions
• Progress bar styling
• Drag-and-drop UI for contract matching

🔧 MAKING CHANGES:

The README includes quick-reference guides for:
- Changing colors (all in one CSS file)
- Adjusting the gradient
- Modifying spacing and layout
- Editing page content
- Tweaking shadows and transparency

All styling uses CSS variables for easy theming!

💡 KEY PAGES TO CHECK:

1. Carrier Contacts (👋) - Form entry page with conditional fields
2. Account & Contracts (📦) - Drag-and-drop matching interface
3. Invoice Forwarding (💌) - Multi-option configuration
4. Tracking API (🔑) - Credential input
5. Warehouse Data (🏭) - File upload with guidelines

🎯 YOUR FEEDBACK NEEDED:

- Does the purple theme feel professional yet inviting?
- Is the layout too spacious or just right?
- Should we use icon library instead of emoji?
- Any UX friction points in the flow?
- Mobile version needed? (currently desktop-optimized)

⏱️ TIMELINE:

No rush - take your time to explore. Would love to hear your initial thoughts by [date], but let me know if you need more time.

🆘 NEED HELP?

If you hit any snags:
1. Check the Troubleshooting section in the README
2. Most issues are solved by: npm cache clean --force && npm install
3. DM me anytime - happy to pair on setup if needed!

Really excited to hear your thoughts on this! The gradient turned out beautifully, and I think you'll love the drag-and-drop contract matching interface.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. If you want to experiment with different color schemes, all the theme colors are in client/src/styles/global.css starting at line 7. The gradient definition is around line 28. Have fun! 🎨
